                            I have been playing chess for over a decade, and it is one of my most long-lasting passions. I compete in state and national level tournaments, am second board on my school's Top 10 State Chess Team, and even volunteer at my local library's chess club. One of my biggest personal achievements is becoming an official USCF tournament director and hosting my own tournaments with 200+ people. Well organized tournaments were the reason I became so invested in chess, and I hope to pass that experience on to inspire younger players.

                            Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by my dad's computer science job and have always wanted to go into a tech-related field. After entering high school, I have done all that I can to stay updated and experience the industry I hope to go into someday. Something that particularly fascinates and excites me is how fast the field is advancing, as I love to be constantly learning.

                            I have always been an avid reader, waking up at 5 am when I was younger to finish a book I was particularly interested in. I have countless memories of my childhood going through book after book while curled up on the couch, whether it be Magic Tree House or Percy Jackson. Even though I've grown older and have less free time, I still haven't lost my love for reading. I'll read anything science fiction or fantasy, and some of my favorite books include Project Hail Mary, Eragon, and of course, a childhood favorite: Harry Potter.

                            Math is something I find incredibly fun and rewarding. I have pursued this passion since I was young, enrolling in advanced math classes and doing Khan Academy out of class to learn even more. After transferring to IMSA, I've taken the accelerated BC Calculus course, become an active member of the math team, got to the Illinois Council of Teachers of Mathematics (ICTM) State Competition, and become a Finalist for MathCON, a nationwide math competition with thousands of students. Mostly, I do math because I enjoy it.

                            I have accumulated over 500 hours of volunteering experience through a wide range of activities, including serving on the local library‚Äôs advisory group, assisting at the local chess club and chess tournaments, tutoring at a local center, working as a Peer Tutor at my school, volunteering at Feed My Starving Children, and contributing to many other initiatives. I love to give back to the community whenever possible!
